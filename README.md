# Description
Minesweeper is a game which objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. The main objective of this project is  applying a Q-Learning algorithm that solves the game most efficiently in the manner of one of the following conditions ( least attempts until success, least moves until success on an average of X games, etc.). The main page also contains a code area where any user could submit his own algorithm to the server and see how his version works in real time.
